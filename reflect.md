# Reflection

### Learning
- Structuring javacript like basic games such as a core game loop, animations, scene management
- using a pixel art program called Aesprite to draw some sprites to be used, also some animating them to be gifs
- keyboard inputs to move characters as well as mapping movement to buttons
- when to use flex/ grid

### Game Complexity
Game is split accordingly:
- Constants / Button initialization
- Game Varaibles with reset functions
- Points System
- Keyboard Events
- State/Scene Management

- Serving Scene
- In-Play Scene

- Collision
- Core Game Loop/ Drawing characters

I focused on each of these sections individually so there are some weird structuring that could be refactored but overall it hightlights the way I managed to tackle each aspect of the game itself

### AI
- Used ChatGPT to start creating the game. I used it to develop concepts such as movement and collisions. It helped me develop a PONG starter which enabled me to write my own code that essentailly builds on it.
